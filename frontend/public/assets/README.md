Place your background images in this folder:

## Required Images:

1. **login-bg.jpg** - Background image for the login page
   - Recommended size: 1920x1080 or higher
   - Should be visually appealing but not too busy to ensure text readability

2. **chat-bg.jpg** - Background image for the chat homepage
   - Recommended size: 1920x1080 or higher
   - Should be subtle enough to not interfere with chat messages

## Image Guidelines:

- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Size**: Keep under 2MB for optimal loading
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 recommended
- **Style**: Choose images that complement the dark theme with glass effects

## Current Setup:
